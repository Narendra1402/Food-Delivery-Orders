Key Highlights:
🔹 Total rolls ordered and unique customer orders 📦
🔹 Successful deliveries by each driver 🚗
🔹 Most and least popular roll types 🍱
🔹 Relationship between order volume and delivery time ⏳
🔹 Customer ordering trends by time and day of the week 📅
🔹 Driver efficiency: average pickup time, speed, and success rate 📊

Tech Stack:
✅ SQL (CTEs, Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions)
✅ Data Cleaning & Transformation
✅ Performance Optimization

💡 Key Learnings:
🔹 Optimizing queries for performance improvement
🔹 Using CTEs and window functions for better data analysis
🔹 Deriving actionable insights from raw data

Excited to explore more data analytics challenges and refine my SQL skills further! If you're working on similar projects or have feedback, let's connect and discuss. 🚀
